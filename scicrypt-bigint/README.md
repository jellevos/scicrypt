This crate implements a `BigInteger`, for which most arithmetic operations take a constant amount of time given the specified sizes. This crate is nothing more than a convenient wrapper around the low-level constant-time functions from GMP.

If the crate is not working as expected, consider running with `--debug` to hit the `debug_assert!()`s, to check that the preconditions are met for some of the low-level functions.

Almost all function should run in constant-time, and only leak information about the length of the inputs. This also holds for overloaded operators (e.g. equality is constant-time). Some functions are **not** constant-time:
- Initializing from strings using `from_string`
- `partial_cmp_leaky`
- `lcm_leaky`
- `mod_u_leaky`
- `set_bit_leaky` and `clear_bit_leaky`
- `is_probably_prime_leaky`

**Warning: Additions currently leak the carry. We are working on overcoming this limitation.**

To make code easier to read, one can call `leak()` on an `UnsignedInteger` to get a `LeakyUnsignedInteger` that supports overloaded operators for leaky operations.

We are unsure about random number generation.
Also note that division may leak some information about the size of the resulting value.
